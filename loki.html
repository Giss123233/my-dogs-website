      <h2>La alegria de la casa</h2>
      <p>
        Loki era mucho mas travieso y jugueton. 
        Le gustaba acurrucarse, mirar por la ventana y seguirme a todos lados.  
        Tenia una mirada tierna que transmite calma y cari√±o, al igual que una mirada sospechosa que te hacia pensar que estaba tramando su siguiente travesura. Mi hermano solia decir que su mirada sospechosa la saco de mi. 
        Su presencia era como un abrazo silencioso en los d√≠as dif√≠ciles.

    <h1>Loki</h1>
    <p>When I was little, I had a dog. It died because a car ran over it. I was devastated since it </p>
    <p>had been with me my whole childhood. I remember crying all night.</p>
    <p>I was always the spoiled one in the family, so when my parents saw how sad I was, they</p>
    <p>decided to buy me a tiny dog, one that wouldn‚Äôt grow much and could live safely inside the </p>
    <p>house. They wanted to get me a mini toy French poodle, one of those tiny dogs that wouldn‚Äôt</p>
    <p>need to go outside, so it could stay out of cars and traffic.</p>
    <p>We started looking for one of those dogs and spent a whole week searching. During that</p>
    <p>week, I was so sad I didn‚Äôt even want to sleep. My parents decided to speed up the search </p>
    <p>because they could see how upset I was. They checked pet shops and also looked online, </p>
   <p>searching on marketplace sites and in local groups. Finally, they found one two hours away from</p> 
    <p>where we lived, my dad went to pick up it. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that my dad didn‚Äôt know</p>
    <p>anything about dogs, much less about the different breeds or what they were supposed to look</p>
    <p>like.</p>
    <p>When he got back with the dog, I was so happy that I couldn‚Äôt stop hugging it. However,</p>
    <p>I noticed that my parents and siblings seemed a bit worried, quietly talking amongst themselves.</p>
    <p>But I was too busy meeting my new friend to pay much attention to what they were saying.</p>
    <p>Finally, my mom came over and told me that this little dog didn‚Äôt look like a mini toy or even</p>
    <p>like a small dog at all. She was right. The dog seemed a bit dizzy, barely able to walk, and it </p>
    <p>didn‚Äôt want to eat or drink any water.</p>
    <p>It was already ten at night but my dad decided to take the dog to the vet. The vet gave us </p>
    <p>the bad news: we had been conned. The dog wasn‚Äôt the breed they‚Äôd told us it was. Worse still, </p>
    <p>the vet said that the conditions in which the dog had been kept were terrible; it was infested with</p>
    <p>fleas and parasites that were practically eating it alive. The vet prescribed medication to help, but </p>
    <p>he also warned us that the dog was in such delicate condition that it might not survive the night.</p>
    <p>To our surprise, however, the dog was still alive the next day and seemed a little stronger. </p>
    <p>And in just a week, it was playing and following me everywhere I went, and making a mess all </p>
    <p>over the house. Over time, instead of staying small as we had expected, it grew to be a </p>
    <p>medium-sized dog, nothing like a mini toy.</p>
    <p>Today, every time I look at my dog, I remember everything he went through. We later </p>
    <p>found out his real breed: he‚Äôs a Jack Russell Terrier. And even though he wasn‚Äôt the little dog we </p>
    <p>had planned on, he became my best friend.</p>
